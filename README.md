## Based on the given financial data create a ML model to predict if the client is high risk or low risk if we were to provide them loan.

##  We need to predict the column Risk_Flag and it contains value 1 if the client is high risk else it will be 0.

## 1. Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset.
Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables.
Normalize/Standardize numerical variables if necessary.
Split the data into training and testing sets.

1. Load the Dataset: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Descriptive Statistics: Generate summary statistics of the dataset.
3. Missing Values: Check for missing values in the dataset.
4. Correlation Analysis: Analyze the correlation between different features and the target variable.
5. Visualizations: Create various visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships of the data.

## 2. Model Selection and Training:

Choose a suitable classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).
Train the model on the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.

## Here is a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. Load the Dataset
2. Identify Numerical Features
3. Plot Distributions

First, let's load the dataset. If you have the dataset file, please upload it. If not, please provide the column names and some sample data, and I'll create a synthetic dataset for demonstration.

## 3. Model Evaluation:

Use appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to evaluate the model.
## 4. Model Deployment:

Save the trained model for future use.
